# Task Manager API
Task Manager API is a simple RESTful API built using Node.js and Express.js.
It allows users to perform CRUD operations on tasks such as creating, reading, updating, and deleting tasks.

The API stores data in memory (no database) and returns responses in a consistent JSON format.
Additional features include searching tasks by title and viewing task statistics.
